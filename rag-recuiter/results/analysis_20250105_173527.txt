Experience in test automation, performance testing, test case design, and test \ncase writing. Experience with the Micro Service Architecture and AWS services (Enterprise Grade). \n\nPROJECTS \n•  AI/ML Football Analysis system with YOLO, OpenCV, and Python- Used a pre-trained model YOLOv5xu. \n\nAdditional training was done to identify only the players and referees within the football court. Use of ball \ninterpolation for predicting the ball's path and tracking the ball, use of color segmentation to assign players \nwith team color, use of camera movement estimators and perspective transformer to calculate the speed and \ndistance covered by each player within the desired polygon. \n\n•  Medi Plus Hospital Management System- As the Lead Developer, I was responsible for building the \n\nfoundation of a comprehensive Healthcare Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, \nReact.js, Node.js). My role involved implementing multi-factor authentication and role-based access control \nto ensure system security. I developed a fully integrated patient management system catering to both \ninpatient and outpatient care and incorporated customer support features to enhance user assistance. \nAdditionally, I integrated third-party APIs, including Google Authentication, for secure login. The completed \nsystem was successfully delivered to the client, receiving an A grade for its excellence and functionality. \n\n•  Food Delivery WebApp- Group project developed using the JAVA servlets, JSP, SQL, and Bootstrap. \n\nComplete food delivery app with user, support, inventory, payment, coupon, and review management \nfunctionalities. Core OOP concepts of JAVA were explored in this project and many design patterns such as \nsingleton were incorporated for this project. Submitted for OOP and received a score of 100%. \n\n•  Spring Boot Application Based on Micro Service Architecture – Spring Boot application with complete \n\nmicroservice architecture implemented. Key Cloak for authentication, Kafka for asynchronous \ncommunication, Grafana for observability of the APIs, and complete Circuit Breaker pattern implemented for \nall the APIs. All services with the corresponding modules are deployed to Kubernetes.  \n\n•  Coffee Shop with LLM RAG System- A simple coffee shop application with a complete RAG system. Complete \nagent system implemented comprising of guard agent- prevents unnecessary prompts of the user from being \nunanswered by the LLM, Classification agent – capable of guiding the users to the relevant agent based on \nuser prompt, Order agent- adds orders of the user to the cart, Recommendation agent- provides \nrecommendations to the user based on statistical data which the model was trained with and a Details agent- \nprovides details about the coffee shop and menu item details to the user by allowing the LLM to access a \nVector database(Pinecone) comprising about the details about the coffee shop. The model used in this \napplication was Llama 3.0 and endpoints were deployed to Runpod. The applicated was built using React \nExpo and the backend was deployed to Docker. \n\n•  Waste Management Application (Zero Waste)- Several components were implemented to provide a robust \nwaste management application. With automated driver assignments, tracking waste levels and requests \nbased on several criteria such as district and waste categories, a complete dynamic system with the creation \n\n \n \n \n\x0cof districts, driver profiles, and waste categories. This system was implemented with a Node backend and a \nReact front end.  \nEXTRA-CURRICULAR  \n\nMembership                                                          IEEE in SLIIT                                                  December 2023-Present \n•  Design Lead - Perpetual 4.0, IASpire, Design Co-Lead – Interfuse 24, Design member- Lazarus 2.0, \n\nFinance Co-Lead- ILLUMIN 24, Finance member- JamborIEEE, CyberShiled, INSL (Innovation Nation Sri \nLanka)-Design member \n\n     Membership                                                          AIESEC in SLIIT                                               February 2024-Present \n\n•  OCVP Partnership Development- Kokila Rawaya 2024 \nBatch Rep                                                         SLIIT Metro Campus                                             August 2023-Present \n\n• \n\nBatch representative for Y2. \n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS                                          \nLanguages/Tools/Frameworks/Concepts \n•  Java (Object Orientated Programming), PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Spring Boot, Docker and Kubernetes \n•  MERN, SQL, Kotlin, C, C++, Git, Agile methodology, Data structures and algorithms \n\nREFERENCES \nDr. Kalpani Manathunga \nHead of Department Software Engineering, Contact- 077 350 3324, Email- kalpani.m@sliit.lk \nMrs. Anjalie Gamage \nSenior Lecturer, Contact- 077 350 3324, Email- anjalie.g@sliit.lk \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c", 'structured_data': "Here is the extracted information from the resume in a clear and structured format:\n\n**Personal Information**\n\n* Name: Asiri Jayawardena\n* Contact Number: +94 75 826 4839\n* Address: Mt Lavania, Dehiwala\n\n**Education**\n\n* **Sri Lanka Institute of Information and Technology**\n\t+ Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Software Engineering)\n\t+ Relevant Coursework: Java OOP, Web Programming, OSSA, Data Structures, and Algorithms and Android development\n\t+ Academic Achievements:\n\t\t- Current CGPA: 3.94/4.0\n\t\t- Dean's List recipient for Y1S1, Y1S2, Y2S1, and Y2S2\n\n**Experience**\n\n* **Intern**, Sysco Labs (September 2024-Present)\n\t+ Quality Assurance Engineering\n\t+ Experience in test automation, performance testing, test case design, and test case writing\n\t+ Experience with Micro Service Architecture and AWS services (Enterprise Grade)\n\n**Projects**\n\n* **AI/ML Football Analysis System**\n\t+ Used pre-trained model YOLOv5xu for ball tracking and prediction\n\t+ Implemented ball interpolation, color segmentation, camera movement estimators, and perspective transformer\n* **Medi Plus Hospital Management System**\n\t+ Lead Developer (MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)\n\t+ Implemented multi-factor authentication and role-based access control for system security\n\t+ Developed a patient management system with inpatient and outpatient care features\n* **Food Delivery WebApp**\n\t+ Group project using Java servlets, JSP, SQL, and Bootstrap\n\t+ Explored core OOP concepts of Java and incorporated design patterns (singleton)\n* **Spring Boot Application Based on Micro Service Architecture**\n\t+ Implemented Spring Boot application with complete microservice architecture\n\t+ Used Key Cloak for authentication, Kafka for asynchronous communication, Grafana for observability, and Circuit Breaker pattern\n* **Coffee Shop with LLM RAG System**\n\t+ Implemented agent system comprising of guard agent, Classification agent, Order agent, Recommendation agent, and Details agent\n\t+ Used Llama 3.0 model with Pinecone vector database\n* **Waste Management Application (Zero Waste)**\n\t+ Implemented automated driver assignments, tracking waste levels, and requests based on criteria\n\n**Certifications/Awards**\n\n* None mentioned in the resume\n\n**Skills**\n\n* Programming Languages: Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes\n* Development Frameworks: MERN, SQL, Kotlin, C, C++\n* Agile Methodology: Yes\n* Data Structures and Algorithms: Yes\n\n**References**\n\n* Dr. Kalpani Manathunga (Head of Department Software Engineering)\n\t+ Contact Number: 077 350 3324\n\t+ Email: kalpani.m@sliit.lk\n* Mrs. Anjalie Gamage (Senior Lecturer)\n\t+ Contact Number: 077 350 3324\n\t+ Email: anjalie.g@sliit.lk", 'extraction_status': 'Completed'}, 'analysis_results': {'skills_analysis': "Based on the provided information, here's a detailed analysis of the candidate profiles:\n\n**1.
